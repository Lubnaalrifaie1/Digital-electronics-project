# **Number of Factors**

- The factors will be recognised by this circuit. It would be somewhere between zero and fifteen. When a number is a factor of another number, it means that the first number must completely divide the second number without leaving any residue.
- To put it another way, if a number If any number (divisor) is exactly divisible by (dividend), then the divisor is a factor of that number.
- dividend. Each number has a common factor, which is one, as well as the number itself. So generally, this circuit will take binary numbers as inputs and produce binary numbers as outputs such as the number of elements that the input number has in form, including one and itself of binary digits.
